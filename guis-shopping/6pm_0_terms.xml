If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please follow our Notice and Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement.&#10;&#10;REMEDIES&#10;&#10;You agree that our remedy at law for any actual or threatened breach of this Agreement would be inadequate and that we shall be entitled to specific performance or injunctive relief, or both, in addition to any damages that we may be legally entitled to recover, together with reasonable expenses of any form of dispute resolution, including, without limitation, attorneys&apos; fees.&#10;&#10;No right or remedy of ours shall be exclusive of any other, whether at law or in equity, including without limitation damages injunctive relief, attorneys&apos; fees and expenses.&#10;&#10;No instance of waiver by us of our rights or remedies under these terms and conditions shall imply any obligation to grant any similar, future or other waiver.&#10;&#10;APPLICABLE LAW&#10;&#10;By using the Site, you agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the state of Nevada, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Terms of Use and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and us.&#10;&#10;DISPUTES&#10;&#10;Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of the Site, or to any products or services sold or distributed by us or through 6pm.com will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.&#10;&#10;There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Terms of Use as a court would.&#10;&#10;To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent CSC Services of Nevada, Inc., 2215-B Renaissance Drive, Las Vegas, NV 89119. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA&apos;s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA&apos;s rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA&apos;s rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, we will not seek attorneys&apos; fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.&#10;&#10;We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.&#10;&#10;SEVERABILITY&#10;&#10;If any these provisions shall be deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that condition shall be deemed several and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provision.&#10;&#10;OUR ADDRESS&#10;&#10;Please send any questions or comments (including all inquiries unrelated to copyright infringement) regarding this Site to:&#10;&#10;Zappos IP, Inc. , 400 E.
