AboutLibraries Mike Penz

AboutLibraries is a library to offer you all the information
you need of your libraries!

Most modern apps feature an Used Library-Section and
for this some information of those libs is required. As it
gets annoying to copy those strings always to your app
I have developed this small helper library to provide the
required information.
