                \n                            Preamble\n\n  The GNU General Public\
                \ License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds\
                \ of works.\n\n  The licenses for most software and other practical\
                \ works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change\
                \ the works.  By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended\
                \ to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a\
                \ program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.\
                \  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License\
                \ for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released\
                \ this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\
                \n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n\
                price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\
                \ you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and\
                \ charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can\
                \ get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use\
                \ pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do\
                \ these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others\
                \ from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.\
                \  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute\
                \ copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to\
                \ respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute\
                \ copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must\
                \ pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.\
                \  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source\
                \ code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\
                \n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n\
                (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\n\
                giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\
                \n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\n\
                that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users'\
                \ and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked\
                \ as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously\
                \ to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed\
                \ to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the\
                \ software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This\
                \ is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users'\
                \ freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such\
                \ abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which\
                \ is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave\
                \ designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\n\
                products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains,\
                \ we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future\
                \ versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\
                \n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\n\
                States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\n\
                software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish\
                \ to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program\
                \ could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL\
                \ assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\
                \n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n\
                modification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\
                \n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the\
                \ GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like\
                \ laws that apply to other kinds\nof works, such as semiconductor\
                \ masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed\
                \ under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"\
                Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\
                \n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of\
                \ the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than\
                \ the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"\
                modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the\
                \ earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified\
                \ Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a\
                \ work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would\
                \ make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under\
                \ applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or\
                \ modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution\
                \ (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic,\
                \ and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\"\
                \ a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties\
                \ to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\n\
                a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\
                \n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\
                \nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\n\
                feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\n\
                tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\n\
                extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\n\
                work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. \
                \ If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such\
                \ as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\
                \n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the\
                \ preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"\
                Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard\
                \ Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard\
                \ defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces\
                \ specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely\
                \ used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System\
                \ Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan\
                \ the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\n\
                packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\n\
                Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\n\
                Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\n\
                implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\
                \"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n\
                (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n\
                (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\n\
                produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n\
                \  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means\
                \ all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\n\
                work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts\
                \ to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the\
                \ work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally\
                \ available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing\
                \ those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example,\
                \ Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated\
                \ with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared\
                \ libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically\
                \ designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or\
                \ control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\
                \n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\n\
                can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\n\
                Source.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form\
                \ is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted\
                \ under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the\
                \ Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are\
                \ met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission\
                \ to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered\
                \ work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\n\
                content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\n\
                rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\
                \n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\n\
                convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\n\
                in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\n\
                of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide\
                \ you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you\
                \ comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material\
                \ for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running\
                \ the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf,\
                \ under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from\
                \ making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship\
                \ with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted\
                \ solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not\
                \ allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users'\
                \ Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall\
                \ be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any\
                \ applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO\
                \ copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting\
                \ or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey\
                \ a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention\
                \ of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected\
                \ by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered\
                \ work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification\
                \ of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers,\
                \ your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\n\
                technological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You\
                \ may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\n\
                receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately\
                \ publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact\
                \ all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms\
                \ added in accord with sec\u2026"

            the right to refuse or cancel an order for any reason including limitations
            on quantities available for purchase, inaccuracies, or errors in product
            or pricing information, or problems identified by our credit and fraud
            avoidance department. If your order is canceled after your credit card
            (or other payment account) has been charged, we will issue a credit to
            your credit card (or other applicable payment account) in the amount of
            the charge. We will contact you if all or any portion of your order is
            canceled or if additional information is required to accept your order.
            Walmart may request a pre-authorization for some orders placed online
            with a credit or debit card. This pre-authorization will not be billed
            to you; however, your card issuer may hold this amount for a short period.
            Your card issuer determines the length of time the pre-authorization is
            held. We do this to ensure that the card details are still valid and that
            you have sufficient funds to complete the transaction.
