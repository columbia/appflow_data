including without limitation creating, accessing or using
your membership in the Beauty Insider Program, or the
Sephora Community. We may add additional services or
features to Sephora Mobile from time to time and these
Terms of Use will govern those new services and
features when added.

If you register for a Sephora account, you will have four
pages associated with your Sephora account, including

Sephora has an online social community
("Community"). Community allows you to participate in
Sephora Groups, Sephora Conversations, and the
Sephora Gallery, to provide Ratings & Reviews, and to
receive product recommendations. These Terms of Use
govern your participation in the Community.
